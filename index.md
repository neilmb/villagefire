<blockquote>
Words and music need only breath and spirit to live. --Pete Seeger
</blockquote>

Do you long to twine your voice with others in song? Do you love to be outside
among trees, water, and sky?  Do you know the pleasure of gathering with
people of all ages? 

Come join the growing global community movement that is knitting the world
together through songs of love, play, spirit, and freedom. Nestle into a
beautiful setting amongst the ancient bluffs of the Driftless, where a creek
runs through the center and we eat real food made with soul. Play, sing,
dance, and rest your bones by the fire. 

<div class="center"><img src="images/kidsdance.jpg"/></div>

We’ll sing songs to gather people and explore the ways we can use singing to
deepen our sense of communion with each other and our sacred respect and
wonder in the face of all nature. We’ll sing easy-to-learn, playfully
challenging songs that speak to critical themes—environmental, social,
interpersonal—in a way that brings joy, a sense of success, and an expression
of shared meaning.  

Learn with songleaders whose love for group singing inspires us all. Relax
into the voice you were born to sing with as we share beautiful, fun, simple
songs that can reshape our world. 

<blockquote>
We are the gift between earth and heaven<br/>
We are the song between sky and ground<br/>
Sing for your life and for this world we’re making<br/>
Nothing is lost that can’t be found
</blockquote>

## The music

How do we go beyond sustainability and learn to thrive again? How do we
entertain, inspire, create? How do we make connection with each other without
elaborate technology, using simply the inner resources we were born with?

<div class="center"><img src="images/bigcircle.jpg"/></div>

We raise our voices together in songs that celebrate love, diversity, power,
the rhythms of the year, and the circle of life. We sing songs for times when
comfort is needed, and songs that remind us of our ancestors. We sing songs to
give us courage in our work to re-wild the world. We sing songs from home and
songs from afar. We sing silly songs and songs that invite dancing, songs that
you can take home and sing the rest of your life.  By the circular,
non-hierarchical, harmonious intertwining of our voices we bring light to the
world.

## Our Songleaders

Experienced and dedicated songleaders bring gems from their own living
communities to teach to us. Opportunities abound for other emerging
songleaders as well, as all are welcomed to share the songs of their
communities. In the spirit of bringing more singing into every nook and cranny
of our country, a group discussion will be held to exchange ideas about
community songleading for our times. 

Songleaders include [Barbara McAfee](http://barbaramcafee.com), Francis Gurtz
and Colette Miller, Ellen Rockne, and Liz Rog. More songleaders will be
announced in the weeks to come.

Very Special 2014 Guest Laurence Cole  comes from Port Townsend, Washington to
share with us his wonderful songs and powerful leadership. Laurence brings a
wealth of experience and inspiration to his songleading, borne of his 70+
years of music making. Village Fire 2014 will feature many of his songs, and
his presence will make this an unforgettable year. 

Laurence says we're…

##### Singing Together to Nourish the Soul and Re-enchant the world with song…

<blockquote class="textquote">
“Part of my mission is to re-acquaint people with their birthright and natural
ability to make beautiful and meaningful sound together. Most of the songs
I’ve written are short, easy to learn, chant-like songs with several layers
that fit over and around each other in interesting and pleasurable rhythmic
and harmonic challenges that make them fun to sing. Group singing is one of
the most ancient and primal ‘technologies of belonging’ that we humans have
been using since our earliest times, possibly before speech itself. When we
make joyous and passionate song together, it nourishes our souls and offers an
enlivening gift back to the natural world that made us and gives us our
sustenance and our very being. When such an exchange is genuinely made, and
the song finds its natural ending, often there is a sweet, lively silence in
which we simply stand and hold the ‘enchantment,’ the sense of deep and
genuine communion.”

hardwood forests, limestone cliffs, caves, and a meandering trout stream. From
the moment we arrive we will begin to create the community we love, welcoming
each other and opening our circles to include all. We will make a home there
and work together to care for the land, water, creatures, and people of our
community.  [Click here for a map.](https://goo.gl/maps/9v8wp)

Ruthie is keeping the cost of our meals low by inviting our help in the

This will add to the fun!

* Kids 11 and under, bringing your own food: $25 - $50

## How Our Schedule Works

Upon our arrival we create a plan for song circles according to the desires
and skills of those present on any given day. In this way we are able to
schedule just the right number and type of circles for the number and
interests of those present. This is a transformational method of
self-organizing sometimes known as Open Space Technology, and our use of it
brings forth the best of our skills and passions. You’ll be glad to be part of
this way. 

Some themes and specialties of last year’s regional songleaders included:

* *Songs for Ritual and Celebration.* These are simple songs you'll be able to
  pull out of your memory when it's time to mark life's beginnings, endings,
  birthdays, homecomings, the turning of the seasons, and more.
* *Songs for Kids and Those Who Love Them.* Early American dancing games, silly
  songs, and songs that celebrate the beauty of our diverse world. 
* *Singing for Rowdies and Rascals—with a Brief Foray into Kumbaya* 
* *Dances of Universal Peace.* The Dances of Universal Peace are spiritual
  practice in motion. Drawing on the sacred phrases, scripture, and poetry of
  the many spiritual traditions of the earth, the Dances blend chant, live
  music and evocative movement into a living experience of unity, peace and
  integration
* *Songs of the annual gathering 'Singing Alive!'* Birthed in the bosom of the
  Pacific NW eco-festivals. This event is about bringing people together who
  feel called to awaken, and nurture their spiritual life through communion
  with songs, prayers, chants, and blessings, of celebration of life in this
  temple universe. 
* *Civil Rights and Movement Songs.* A singing movement is a winning movement,
  and there are lots of great peoples songs from struggles for liberation
  around the world. Both familiar and new, both old and recent.
* *Songs of Comfort and Healing* for those struggling with living or dying. The
  spirit of the music ranges from gentle and soothing to uplifting and lively.
  Though they hold this work sacred, they do not adhere to a particular
  religious tradition.
* *Group Improvisational Singing and Chanting*
* *Drumming and Dancing*
* *Songs from Other Lands and Times*
* *Simple Four-Part Beauties* that Sound Like the Mormon Tabernacle Choir! Layer
  songs, spirituals, and sacred songs from world traditions.
* *Songs Pete Seeger Taught Us.* In honor of one of our most beloved American
  heroes!
